well, today was idk it was very diff than i thought it would be tbh, last night i was all sad and i couldnt help but think bout my babie, idk i felt very empty dad and granny fought and granny was yk tryna blame mom for the things which she doesnt do and basically she hates her and uh yep, yesterday was all js shouting and fighting yk not w me but them all and ye, so i was js listening to music and staring through the window all night kanna, yesterday i was yk listening to the song "every breath you take" song and i realized how much it meant for me. cus yk while listening to it reminded me of her so much idk what to say and thats when i cried and i sent her the photo of it too. idk why dat song reminds me of her than anything else but i am glad it does. if there was truly a song which i would dedicate to and remember you everytime i hear it, then it would be "every breath you take". it js means a lot dont ask why cus even idk babie maybe cus of the story we kept, we used that song in dat story

never the less, uh i started this journal online cus if it was on a book it anyone might look at it but if it is on my pc no one can look at it and if youre looking at it rinu, this journal ill take prints of these turn into a book and give it to you to read and i am gonna write on my pc like this until i get enough freedom to write on a book my dear.

well today lets see, i woke up at 6:40-ish ig and right after i woke up i realized i slept and i thought i'd be awake but ye, and after that i didnt grab my phone until a while, after that i read the  texts from her and i replied to a few then put it back again and ye pretty much thats how my morning was, and after that me and my dad had arguement bout the attendance message college sent, well 90% attendance rate in 12th is not necessary but they still sent a message and dad doesnt believe me anyways after it was done i ate and then got onto my pc and continued with my excel prep and i did complete an assignment and i can say i am getting pretty good at it after that i tried installing rdr 2 but didnt work smh so i js went to watch breaking bad after wasting 2 hours on it. well i started watching breaking bad alot and its really good i am in season 2 ep 3 rn i cant wait to watch more, after that i went to nishil's and there i taught him how to solve a cube apparantly he cant do the top layer but i cant blame him even i found it hard tbh. anyways after that we went to bhaviks home area and js roamed there for a while, while doing that we found vishnu and we wnated to go to rudhras home but he wasnt lifting call so we dropped of vishnu and then went to bhaviks place where we did a few side tasks and after that we saw a few career paths and i think he finally do the same exam as me and get into the same college as me and its gonna be the best for us as we can share a pg and i will have a partner or a friend w me ig lmao, anyways thats for today i kinda feel eepy and idk when i will eep but i will soon prolly anyways thats it for today.

goodbye.
